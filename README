Hi!

You have just downloaded the source for various example engines I've created
for demo purposes of the storage engine API in memcached.

C++
===

I know that a lot of people dislike C, and would prefer to use C++ to
create their engine. To show you how to write an engine in C++, I decided
to create a small engine using STL containers to store the objects in.
You'll find this implementation in src/stl

Hope you will find the example(s) interesting.

Cheers,

Trond Norbye
